My source engine textures
--------------------INSTRUCTIONS-------------------
Requirements : Steam, A Source Game (not source 2 nor goldsource) - I Will list them later.
First open your local game files. then go to your game folder (in my case i will use garry's mod as example)
Example : GarrysMod/garrysmod
then go to the "materials" folder, and move the "custom" folder to the "materials" folder
--------------------list--------------------------
oke, there is 3 sources. 
goldsource, imma call it gsrc
source, imma call it src
source 2, imma call it src2
.-.
gsrc has more of a doom style.
src is (not so much) realistic
src2 is realistic.
i will use most cheap games as a base,
.-.
Half-Life 1 = Noticeable low quality.
Team Fortress 2 = high quality, but when too close you notice pixelation.
Counter-Strike 2 = HD, Almost innoticeable pixelation
