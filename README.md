# vmt-vtf "incmap"

My source engine textures

# Instructions
Requirements : Steam, A Source Game (not source 2 nor goldsource) - I Will list them later.

First open your local game files. then go to your game folder (in my case i will use garry's mod as example)

Example : GarrysMod/garrysmod

then go to the "materials" folder, and move the "custom" folder to the "materials" folder


# Naming The Engines
oke, there is 3 sources. 

goldsource, imma call it gsrc

source, imma call it src

source 2, imma call it src2

# Explication

gsrc has more of a doom style.

src is (not so much) realistic

src2 is realistic.

i will use most cheap games as a base,
# List
Half-Life 1 = Noticeable low quality.

Team Fortress 2 = high quality, but when too close you notice pixelation.

Counter-Strike 2 = HD, Almost innoticeable pixelation
# Making my own textures
to do this, you need to download vtfedit, i will leave a zip :P

1. you need a png file, or any compatible format

2. press the import button "File > Import"

3. select yo epic image!!

4. oke, you need a normalmap? check the "Generate Normal Map" checkbox

5. press ok

6. save the texture     
L a. If you are saving your normalmap, name it "normal" or "example_normal_map"

7. go to the tools tab and press Create vmt file.     
L a. to make it easier, you must be loaded in the texture itself, not the normalmap

8. (Optional) Select your normal.vtf file as the normalmap

9. Select the texture itself as the base texture

10. (optional) in the options tab, select the material with "Surface 1" tab

11. mount your vmt into the material folder, make sure you got a custom folder for it, or it might end up messy

12. If you have a normalmap file named as "normal" and you plan to make all the textures normalmap files be named "normal" then make folders for the textures.

13. make a map with the textures and preview how the textures look.

# Extras by altrrx :P
1. to make a map, you might want to see your source game files.
2. go to the "common/sourcegame/bin" folder, not the "common/sourcegame/gamefolder/bin" folder          
3. then go until you find "hammer.exe"
4. watch a youtube totoreel! lel
